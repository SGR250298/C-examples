If you were told to put on your thinking cap and running shoes, most people would wonder what they were getting themselves into.

But that is what more than 1000 pupils did in Dunedin yesterday for the NumberWorks'nWords O'Mathalon, run by the Otago Mathematics Association.

Years 5 to 10 pupils from 60 Otago schools took part in the competition at the Edgar Centre. It was the first time since the O'MAthalon began in 1977 year 5 pupils have participated.

The senior competition for years 11 to 13 was on August 13.

Participants work as a team to solve maths-based problems. Competitors must justify their answer to teammates so the children learn to work in a group and communicate ideas.

At yesterday's event, teams of four participated in two sections. The first consisted of answering 10 questions in 10 minutes. The second was a running competition, in which teams were given two questions and had to run with the answers to the judges.

The winning team received scientific calculators.

Parents and schoolmates lined the stands yesterday cheering on the teams and shouting encouragement to run and think faster.

NumberWorks'nWords manager Jan Burch has been involved in the event for 14 years, getting involved to help promote maths in the junior classes at schools.
